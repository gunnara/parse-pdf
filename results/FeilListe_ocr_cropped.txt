General

This list contains supervision descriptions for all Mk3A/B/E turbine(s) with VMP GlobalTM software. Not all supervisions,
however, is applicable for all variants within this range of turbines. This means you can find supervision descriptions for
supervisions which cannot be reported by given turbine variants.

Acknowledgement Remote Shutdown type StopSlow

- Allowed attempts <n/a> - Max time disconnect 3 second

- Time window <n/a> - Max time eliminate 9 second

- Stabilize period <n/a> Category Manufacturer
Criteria:

This supervision monitors the deviation between pitch positions A, B and C. An alarm is
raised if the maximum deviation between the blades exceeds a predefined threshold.

The supervision is enabled if the following conditions are met:

1. **DevABC\ ActivityLevel** = 2
2. **SafetyPitchActive** is False
3. Absolute value of **ProdCtrl.SP\ RotorSpdEst** > **DevABC\ MinRotSpd**

The alarm is activated if the following additional conditions are met:

1. The maximum pitch deviation is greater than **DevABC\ MaxPitchDev**, if

**DevABC\ DWGAddPitchEnable** = 0

2. The maximum pitch deviation is greater than the sum of **DevABC\ MaxPitchDev** and
**DevABC\ MaxPitchDevAddDWG**, if **DevABC\ DWGAddPitchEnable** = 1 and Dynamic Wind
Guard (DWG) 1s active

3. Either condition 1 or 2 is active for at least **DevABC\ MaxTime** sec

The maximum pitch deviation is calculated as:

1. The three individual pitch references, **PiRM\ PitchPosRefA**, **PiRM\ PitchPosRefB**
and **PiRM\ PitchPosRefC** are low pass filtred with a time constant

**DevABC\ PitchTimeConst**.

2. The pitch error between these filtered references and the corresponding measured pitch
positions, **PitchBladeAAngle**, **PitchBladeBAngle** and **PitchBladeCAngle**, are found
for each blade.

3. The maximum pitch deviation is then calculated as the difference between max pitch
error, **PiSV\ PitchPosMaxError**, and min pitch error, **PiSV\ PitchPosMinError**, among
the three blades.

Dynamic Wind Guard (DWG) is considered active if either DWG StateA, DWG StateB or
DWG StateC is True. Subject to a hysterisis time of **DevABC\ DWGTimeHyst** sec.

Criteria:

Monitors that the grid current of a given phase is symmetric within a certain limit
relative to the other phase currents.

This supervision is a generic description that represents the asymmetric grid current
supervisions in the

converter. Every supervision has different limits and times so that different level of
asymmetric current

is allowed depending on in which mode the generator is connected.

If Generator 1 is connected the limit parameter is **AsymCurrLimGenl**, and the
hystheresis is **AsymCurrHystGenl**.
If Generator 2 is connected the limit parameter is **AsymCurrLimGen2**, and the
hystheresis is **AsymCurrHystGen2**,

*xAsymCurrTime** 1s used for both generator connections.

-- Supervision Criteria --

The supervision continuously monitors the phase RMS grid current on all three phases:
**xCurrentPhasel**,

**CurrentPhase2** and **CurrentPhase3**. If the current of one of these phases is outside
the limit,

a timer is started. For the supervision to be reported the current must not be within the
hysteresis

limit until the timer reaches the timeout. If the current drops/rises to be within the
hysteresis limit

during the running period of the timer, the supervision is not reported and the timer is
reset.

Asymmetrical current is only checked when the 3 phase mean current level is above:

**xAsymCurrCheck** times NomCurrGenO in unconnected.
**xAsymCurrCheck** times NomCurrGenl in Generator 1.
**xAsymCurrCheck** times NomCurrGen2 in Generator 2.

This alarm is raised when the RMS grid current for phase 1 is asymetrical compared to the
mean RMS current

Criteria:

The purpose of this supervision is to shutdown the turbine and avoid start-up when the
wind speed is too high.

This must be done to avoid high loads on the turbine at high wind speeds. A climate
dependent cutout wind speed

can be defined and used instead of the standard setting.

An alarm is raised if the following conditions are met:

1. **WindSpdHighSlow\ ActivityLevel** = 2

2. A filtered wind speed signal is above a certain wind speed limit for a certain time as
defined below.

The wind speed limit and time are specified as follows:

a. The wind speed signal **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** is filtered through a lowpass
filter with time constant **WindSpdHigh\ WindSpdFiltTauSlow**.

b. The filtered wind speed signal is input to a square filter whose output defines the
state of the supervision. The square filter has the following parameters:

* HighHyst = **WindSpdHigh\ CutoutWindSpd** +
**WindSpdHighSlow\ CutoutWindSpdoffset** if
**WindSpdHigh\ ClimateDependentCutoutEnable** = 0

HighHyst = **WindSpdHigh\ ClimateDependentCutoutWindsSpd** +
**WindSpdHighSlow\ CutoutWindSpdoffset** if
**WindSpdHigh\ ClimateDependentCutoutEnable** = 1

* LowHyst = HighHyst - **WindSpdHighSlow\ Hyst**

Criteria:

This supervision monitors excessive oscillations in the drive train.

An alarm is reported if following conditions are met continuously for
**DrvTrn\ OscTripStartTime** sec:

1. **DrvTrn\ ActivityLevel** = 2

2. RotorSpd > DrvTrn MinRotorSpd

3. **AGO\ AGOActive** is false

4. SafetyPitchActive is false

5. Filtered **GeneratorTachoSpeed** is greater than the alarm limit

The above alarm limit is calculated based on current **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed**
filtered with time constant **DrvTrn\ WindSpdFiltTau** and interpolated on the curve
whose x- axis is defined by

**DrvTrn\ WindSpdPoint1**, **DrvTrn\ WindSpdPoint2**, **DrvTrn\ WindSpdPoint3**,
**DrvTrn\ WindSpdPoint4** and y-axis is defined by **DrvTrn\ MaxOscPoint1**,
**DrvTrn\ MaxOscPoint2**, **DrvTrn\ MaxOscPoint3**, **DrvTrn\ MaxOscPoint4**.

The filtered **GeneratorTachoSpeed** is calculated first by passing
**GeneratorTachoSpeed** through discrete second order high pass filter with cutoff
frequency **DrvTrn\ GenSpdOscHpCutoffFregq**.

Then this high pass filtered gen speed is squared, low pass filtered with time constant
**DrvTrn\ GenSpdOscFiltTau**, and finally the square root is taken.

Criteria:

The grid voltage has been too low for too long time. A voltage dip (reduction in grid
voltage) exceededs what
the turbine is allowing.

The alarm ensure that the turbine is stopped if the grid voltage is too low for too long
time. It 1s partly to protect the
turbine, but also to protect the grid and disconnect if the grid conditions are abnormal.

4 parameters (RTt1Px[s], RTUgrid1lPx[pu] and RTt2Px[s], RTUgrid2Px[pu]) describes a
voltage versus time curve

These specifies the minimum allowed grid voltage to a given time after the grid dip has
started.

If the voltage drop is below this curve, either because the voltage becomes too low or
the

duration is too long, this supervision is reported and the turbine is stopped.

The protection function is using the lowest voltage from 4 inputs (3 phase voltages and
the positive sequence voltage)

which it compares with a preset curve from (RTt1Px[s], RTUgrid1lPx[pu]) and (RTt2Px[s],
RTUgrid2Px [pu] )

This 1s not an ordinary alarm. The alarm does not stop the turbine. Rather it is raised
if the turbine stops producing power while heating the gear and is auto acknowledged as
soon as the turbine produces power again or the heating procedure has completed.

The alarm is only used by SCADA and is there for statistical purposes only.

The alarm is raised if the following conditions all are met:

1. The command to the turbine has been Production for some time - i.e.
**xOperationManager.MainTurbineCommandOutput** has been ProductionCmd for more than
**ProductionDelayTime**.

2. The turbine is derated due to cold gear oil or cold gear bearings - 1.e.
**ColdGearOilDerateActive** or **ColdGearBearingsDerateActive** is true.

3. The turbine state is Production or PendingProduction - i.e.
**xOperationManager.MainTurbineState** is Production or PendingProduction.

4, The converter state is different from Connected - i.e. **Converter.ConverterState**
different from Connected.

The alarm is auto acknowledged if any one of the conditions above is not met anymore.

- Stabilize period QO second Category Manufacturer
Criteria:

This supervision monitors the quality of blade load signals by detecting if the blade
load signals has very different standard deviations
A warning is triggered if the following conditions are met:

1. **TYC\ GainHyst\ EnableSv** = 1

2. **Turbine.ProdCtrl.SP\ RotorSpdEst** is greater than

**TYC\ GainHyst\ MinRotSpdForLog**

3. StdMinMaxRatio is continuously less than a wind speed dependent limit for
**TYC\ GainHyst\ PotentialFaultTimeout** seconds

StdMinMaxRatio is calculated as the ratio of the minimum and maximum standard
deviation of the three flapwise root moment signals (**BladeLoadA**, **BladeLoadB**,
**xBladeLoadcC** )

highpass filtered with cutoff frequency **TYC\ GainHyst\ LoadSignalHpFiltFreq**. The
standard deviation estimates are saturated to a minimum value of
**TYC\ GainHyst\ MinBladeLoadStd**.

The standard deviation is calculated for each flapwise root moment with a window
length of **TYC\ GainHyst\ LoadWindowTime**.

The limit for StdMinMaxRatio is calculated based on the average wind speed and
interpolated using a curve having x-axis defined by points
[**TYC\ GainHyst\ WindPoint1**, **TYC\ GainHyst\ WindPoint2**,
**TYC\ GainHyst\ WindPoint3**]
and y-axis defined by [**TYC\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit1**,
**TYC\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit2**, **TYC\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit3**].

The wind speed **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** is averaged with a window length of
**TYC\ GainHyst\ WindWindowTime**.

The warning 1s cleared if:

- **Turbine.ProdCtrl.SP\ RotorSpdEst** drops below **TYC\ GainHyst\ MinRotSpdForLog**
or

- StdMinMaxRatio becomes greater than the current limit plus a hystersis parameter
**TYC\ GainHyst\ StdRatioHyst**.

Criteria:

This supervision monitors the number of blade unlocking attempts and reacts when it
exceeds the maximum attempt.

This alarm is activated if the the following conditions are met:

1. **ProdCtrl.PSC\ UnlockBlades** = 1

2. **BL\ UBA\ ActivityLevel** = 2

3. Number of blade unlock attempts for blade A exceeds the upper threshold,
**BL\ UBA\ MaxAttempts**

Blade unlock functionality should be able to unlock the blade from 90 degrees and place
the blade in the idle position (**BL\ IdlePitchPos**), ready for operation.

The pitch control signal is saturated by **BL\ PropValveLimit** to avoid damaging the
pawl and the wedge during the unlock sequence.

Unlocking of blades is performed by the following steps:

1. Reset the counter for unlock attempts for blade A to zero.

2. If needed, the precise end stop position is established by increasing the pitch
reference and detect when the blade stops.

3. The detected end stop position is validated and if found outside limits, the procedure
1S re-initiated and the unlock attempts counter is incremented

4. Pitching the blade A towards **BL\ IdlePitchPos**.

5. Check if the pitch movement is limited by width of the pawl hole of the wedge for
**BL\ StoppedTime** seconds.

6. If the pitch movement indicates that the pitch is still locked, the blade A will move
back and forth and thereby try to open the lock. **BL\ IdlePitchPos** and

**BL\ HigherLimit** are used as pitch references.

7. Increase the number of blade unlock attempts for blade A by 1.

8. When PitchBladeBAngle <= **BL\ PositiveEndStop** - **BL\ BladeLockWidth**, the pitch
rate is increased to **BL\ PitchRateFast** from **BL\ PitchRate**..

9. Check the blade A is in **BL\ IdlePitchPos** position, indicates that blade A lock is
ready for unlocking.

10. If the blade A has not unlocked, then repeat from step 5 until the blade A is
unlocked.

Unlock the blades by actuating the hydraulic pawl, BladeLockValveOpen, when all three
Blade Locks are ready.

pawl and the wedge during the unlock sequence.

Unlocking of blades is performed by the following steps:

1. Reset the counter for unlock attempts for blade C to zero.

2. Pitching the blade C towards **BL\ IdlePitchPos**.

3. Check if the pitch movement is limited by width of the pawl hole of the wedge for
**BL\ StoppedTime** seconds.

4. If the pitch movement indicates that the pitch is still locked, the blade C will move
back and forth and thereby try to open the lock. **BL\ IdlePitchPos** and

used:

IT.e **LaPMMEnabled** is true, **WindSectorsUsed** is 0,**PartialLoadDefaultMode** is
O and **FullLoadDefaultMode** is 0.
- 2) If there is an overlap between 2 Load & Power Modes sectors. I.e. the direction
range from **WindSectorl.SectorAngleBegin** to **WindSectorl.SectorAngleEnd** must only
be covered by one sector.
- 3) If **WindSectorl.SectorAngleBegin** is different from **WindSectorl.SectorAngleEnd**
for e.g. sector 1 and all the following 3 modes are set to 0 for the same sector:

1. *kWindSectorl.PartialLoadMode** = 0
2. *kWindSectorl. FullLoadLowWindMode** = 0O
3. **WindSectorl.FullLoadHighWindMode** = 0

- The warnings arguments are invalid sector number and related sector configuration.
- The warning can be acknowledged when the parameters are reconfigured to remove the
issues above.

- WindSectorl is used as an example for above parameters.

Criteria:

The purpose of this alarm is to report the re-configuration of ArcNet communication.
Arcnet is the network between the nodes, and it reconfigures if the physical network is
unstable.

The alarm appears when the ArcNet reconfiguration count value **ArcNetReconfigCount** is
greater than the maximum reconfiguration count, set in the parameter
**xArcNetReconfigCountMax**.

This alarm can be acknowledged if the ArcNet reconguration count value
**xArcNetReconfigCount** is less than the maximum reconfiguration count, set in the
parameter **ArcNetReconfigCountMax**.

This alarm is monitored only if the ArcNet supervision is installed i.e the parameter
Ground.ArcNetSupervisioniInstalled is true.

disconnected during the measurement process can interfere with the measurement and give
rare false alarms.

This supervision is raised if the reactive power absorbed by the grid filter is lower
than expected.

Prior to charging the converter the grid filter is activated and only if the reactive
power absorbed by

the grid filter is sufficiently high the turbine is allowed to run. Auxiliary equipment
being connected or

disconnected during the measurement process can interfere with the measurement and give
rare false alarms.

Parl: Difference in reactive power (QL) absorbed by the Gridfilter and expected
absorbtion [kVAr]
Par2: Minimum limit of reactive power for the check to pass [kVAr]

Alarm condition:

The Alarm occurs when the calculated reactive power consumption from the gridfilter
Capacitors are less than the expected

minimum reactive power consumption. The reactive power is calculated based on capacitance
of gridfilter (C GridFilter Module), if the measured reactive power (QL) <

(Q Gridfilter LowFactor)*nominal OL, then the error wil occur. it will do the measurement
in GridFilterFuseCheckTime amount of time.

Possible causes:

* One or more grid filter fuses are blown.
* Contactors to the filters are not working or not wired correct.
* Defect capacitors (each capacitor should absorb approximate 30kVA(50Hz) and 35kVAr
(60Hz)) at rated voltage and the turbine has 6 caps leading to a total Q of 180kVAr
(50Hz) and 210 kVAr (60Hz).
* Tf the phase sequence on the voltages (UL1,UL2,UL3) and currents (IL1,1L2,1L3) are not
correct the measured reactive power

will not be correct and the error can be reported. Only relevant during first run-up of
the turbine.

Check connection from the current transducers to the tru-board and from the tru-board
to the VPC (CT-460).
* The value of reactive power must be positive, if it 1s negative, then either phase
sequence is wrong or wiring on the current transducer / TRU board is switched.

Criteria:

This alarm is raised if the Machine Side Converter (MSC) currents are not balanced
between the converter modules inside each winding-set.

A mean module current is calculated for all active modules (f.x. 1,2,3,4) and phases
(1,2,3) inside each winding-set, and first when the mean current is above Typical = 400A
(RmsIMSCLoadshareActiveLevel ModulePx) the load share protection is active.

The protection is evaluating that all module RMS currents are not larger or smaller than
typical = 12% (RmsIMSCMarginLoadshare ModulePx) of the rated module current of typical =
1135A (IG NOM ModulePx).

If this condition goes on for typical = 3s (MSCLoadShareMaxTimePx) the turbine will be
stopped.

Limits, rated values and duration can vary on different turbine types.

In case a PSC module is taken a higher/lower current share it is reported which module is
taken less/more of its share and which phase the current has been measured too high/low.

3=ModuleC, 4=ModuleD)
Par2 : Phase (1=L1,2=L2, 3=L3)

Possible fault reasons:

The error 1S expected to be generated if a sensor error is present or a PSC module is not
working correct.

Poor cabling between generator and converter modules

Hardware parts not inside specifications (PSC, chokes, Gate drivers etc. )

comments

It is possible to see in toolkit converter monitoring, which module is low/high in
converter current. Alternatively the stream from the converter can be collected for
debugging

To deactivate the alarm the "EnableMSCCurrentLoadSharePx" can be set to 0. (only allowed
for verry controlled troubleshooting, as modules can be overloaded if the current share
1s not correct).

Criteria:

This alarm is raised when the yaw system starts untwisting.
The cable is being untwisted in clockwise (CW) direction.
The untwisting can be initiated by any of the the following events:

1. The cables has been twisted so much that an untwist is required. The amount of twist
is stored in the software signal **CableTwist**. The criterias

for starting the untwisting is dependant on the number of degrees the cable has been
twisted and the current windspeed.
2. The yaw lubrication system has requested the yaw system to turn the nacelle as a part
of a greasing cycle. That is handled by untwisting one

revolution.

Before the untwist is started the generator speed is derated to 0 RPM and the alarm
UntwistCw is raised.

The untwist starts when the generator speed is low enough for starting the search, i.e.
**xGeneratorTachoSpeed** < **YawingOutWindMaxGeneratorRPM**.

When the untwisting has ended, the alarm is automatically acknowledged. During the
untwisting process the alarm cannot be acknowledged.

- Stabilize period <n/a> Category Manufacturer
Criteria:

This warning is raised if the yaw sensor is shifting in
the opposite yaw direction as the yaw motors currently are
turning the nacelle.

The warning may be caused by the CableTwist sensors or the
wiring to the yaw motors or the nacelle position encoder has been fitted incorrectly.

The warning 1s triggered if all the following conditions are true:

* **YawMotorsStarted** and **YawDemand** = YawCW or CCW has been true for the last
**YawMoveDelayTime** time

* **YawDemand** has value "YawCW" and CableTwist decreases OR **YawDemand** has value
"YawCCw" and CableTwist increases

The supervision will collect data for a period of **YawMoveEvalResetTime** seconds.
Everytime the

turbine begins to yaw, the supervision will wait for **YawMoveDelayTime** seconds before
data is collected

for evaluation.

YawDistance is found by integrating **YawSpeed**. After a total collected data of
**YawMoveEvalDelayTime** seconds

the sign of the YawDistance is compared to the expected yaw direction and the warning
activated if YawDistance

has the wrong sign.

The timeout period **YawMoveFvalResetTime** defines the time before the supervision
resets and start

over the evaluation process.

The warning can be acknowledged at any time.

- Stabilize period QO second Category Manufacturer
Criteria:

This alarm is raised when the yaw system starts to search for the reset position of
the nacelle position sensor.

The search for the reset position is needed because the software signal
**xNacellePosition**
has become unavailable.

Some examples of reasons for the **NacellePosition** becoming unavailable:

The nacelle position encoder is out of order

The nacelle has been yawing faster than it can be detected

There has been problems with the reset position of the nacelle position. I.e.
**FilteredNacellePositionReset** has either been missing at the expected reset
position or has been indicating reset at an unexpected position.

Before the search for the reset position is started the generator speed is de-rated
to O RPM and the alarm is raised.

The search for the reset position starts when the wind speed and generator speed is
low enough for starting the search,

1.e. **WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanlOOs** < (**MediumWindStartProduction** -
**xAutomaticYawControlWindHyst**)

and the **GeneratorTachoSpeed** < **YawingOutWindMaxGeneratorRPM**.

The nacelle position is being reset once for each revolution of the nacelle.
The reset happens when one of the following situations happens:

* The signal **FilteredNacellePositionReset** switches from true to false if passed
while yawing counterclockwise

* The signal **FilteredNacellePositionReset** switches from false to true if passed
while yawing clockwise

During the search for the reset position this alarm combined with the de-rate of
generator speed keeps the turbine from producing power.

When the search for the reset position has ended (i.e. reset position is passed) the
alarm is automatically acknowledged.
During the search for the reset position the alarm cannot be acknowledged.

The cable twist reset position is at the position where CableTwistCode shifts from 3 to

Criteria:

This alarm is raised when the YawControlVariantl subsystem is in Extended Yaw mode.
The alarm is caused by either:

* The filtered wind speed exceeds a parameterized limit.
* SCADA/Operator Panel has commanded the turbine into Extended Yaw mode.

The alarm is triggered if **ExtendedYawEnabled** is true and ANY the following conditions
are true:

* Status signal for **WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanlO0Os** is Valid AND
**xWindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanl0O0s** exceeds **ExtendedYawwindStart**
* **ExtendedYawMode** has value "ForcedOn"

The alarm can be acknowledged if **ExtendedYawEnabled** is false OR ALL of the following
two conditions are true:

* Status signal for **WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanlO0Os** is not Valid OR

* Status signal for **WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanlO00Os** is Valid AND

* ValidWindSpeedkxpMeanlOOs is smaller than the difference: **ExtendedYawWindStart** -
**xExtendedYawWindHyst**
* **ExtendedYawMode** has value "Auto"

The alarm is disabled if **ExtendedYawFnabled** is false.

Yawing upwind is highest priority when Extended Yaw is active. Untwist and other
operations keeping the nacelle out of the wind are aborted when Extended Yaw is active.

In auto mode extended yaw is activated by high wind speed. In forced mode extended yaw is
always activated independent of the wind speed.

Criteria:

This alarm is raised if power management 1s activated on the turbine.

The power management is active if either the **PowerSaveActive** or the
**PowerRestrictionActive** signals are activated.

If power save mode is activated the turbine will reduce power consumption as much as
possible and

therefore motors, heaters and other power consuming actuators which are not critical for
the turbine are stopped.

Power save is not allowed if the turbine is in production.

In restricted power mode the turbine must be connected to SCADA in order to request power
when needed.
Power save is activated in restricted power mode.

Restricted power mode is allowed if all the following conditions are met:

* **PowerSupplyRestrictedExternalPowerEnabled** is true

* Turbine is supplied from external generator, i.e. **PowerBackupSource** is external

* Service mode is none

If service mode is entered during restricted power mode, restricted power is deactivated
but the turbine remains

in power save.

The alarm is auto acknowledged when power management is deactivated.

phase 1, 2 and 3 is measured to be wrong, power production cannot be started.

Typically wiring is made wrong of the stator voltage measuring circuit (wires, TRU
board),

check and correct this first. Other problems could be the generator connections or
problems with the VPC.

If the D- stator generator voltage (should be close to zero if the phase sequence is
correct) is above StatPhaseSequenceLim = 20 volt for StatPhaseSegquenceTime = 1 second

Criteria:

This alarm is reported if a De-icing heating cycle is aborted before the normal heating
period has expired.

The alarm must ensure cooling of the blades, since they are not allowed to rotate and be
fully loaded before the cool down period has passed (cool down period is typical 30
minutes).

For turbines with Safety System-8000, this alarm will also be reported after reboot of
Safety System, to ensure the turbine cannot start up while the blades are too warm.

IT.e. the Safety System will always enforce a cooling period after reboot, because the
Safety System cannot determine if blades are too warm.

Remaining cooling period is shown by picture 11.152D as the main contactor ‘Forced Open’
time.

The alarm is auto acknowledged when cooling time has expired.

Criteria:

This supervision monitors the quality of blade load signals by detecting if the blade

A warning is triggered if the following conditions are met:

1. **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ Enable** = 1

2. **SP\ RotorSpdEst** is greater than **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ MinRotSpd**

3. StdMinMaxRatio is continuously less than a wind speed dependent limit for
**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ PotentialFaultTimeout** seconds

StdMinMaxRatio is calculated as the ratio of the minimum and maximum standard
deviation of the three flapwise root moment signals (**BladeLoadA**, **BladeLoadB**,
**xBladeLoadcC** )

highpass filtered with cutoff frequency **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ LoadSignalHpFiltFregq**.
The standard deviation estimates are saturated to a minimum value of
**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ MinBladeLoadStd**.

The standard deviation is calculated for each flapwise root moment with a window
length of **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ LoadWindowTime**.

The limit for StdMinMaxRatio is calculated based on the average wind speed and
interpolated using a curve having x-axis defined by points
[**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ WindPoint1**, **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ WindPoint2**,
**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ WindPoint3**]
and y-axis defined by [**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit1**,
**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit2**, **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit3**].

The wind speed **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** is averaged with a window length of
**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ WindWindowTime**.

The warning 1s cleared if:

- **SP\ RotorSpdEst** drops below TL VTL GainHyst MinRotSpdForLog or

malfunction in the speed sensor or the control system, i.e. the actual speed have not
reached the trigger limit. In this case, the root cause must be identified but an
inspection of gearbox and generator might not be necessary.

The alarm is reported if the virtual signal **I0O.OverspeedGuardMaxShutdownRotorSpeed**

(e.g. signal invalid LogNo.910, no zero cross LogNo.4226, signal dead LogNo.4225).

If other supervisions are not active then the sensor might have been driven into
saturation while the turbine yawing.

If this warning comes often but not any other sensor related alarm (e.g. signal invalid
LogNo.910, no zero cross LogNo.4226, signal dead LogNo.4225)

then the yaw sliding surface shall be lubricated or the yaw lubrication strategy shall be
changed.

This alarm is activated if the following conditions are met
1. Px SSTD Pitch ActivityLevel = 2 OR Px SSTD Power ActivityLevel = 2
2. There are errors in the tower accelerometer measurement (e.g. signal invalid

LogNo.910, no zero cross LogNo.4226, signal dead LogNo.4225)

The alarm is deactivated when the detected tower accelerometer errors are cleared.

Criteria:

The purpose of this supervision is to monitor tower second mode resultant RMS using tower
top accelerometer signals. Tower second

mode resultant value is captured by filtering the tower top accelerometer signals of X
and Y direction around tower second mode frequency.

The alarm is activated when the resultant second mode RMS content is above the threshold
limit defined by the wind speeds. The alarm can

be activated during all operating conditions including stand-still and normal operations.

This alarm is activated if the following conditions are met:

1. Px TowSecMode ActivityLevel = 2
2. When the Tower Acceleration resultant RMS is greater than the threshold. The threshold
value is calculated as follows:

a. by interpolation between TowSecMode TowAccResl and TowSecMode TowAccResz2 , if 15
m/s < **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** <= 20 m/s

b. by interpolation between TowSecMode TowAccRes2 and TowSecMode TowAccRes3 , 1f 20
m/s < **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** <= 25 m/s

c. by interpolation between TowSecMode TowAccRes3 and TowSecMode TowAccRes4 , if 25

Criteria:

This alarm is raised if the yaw speed of the nacelle is slower than a given limit.

The alarm may be caused if **YawMotorsStarted** is true, but the nacelle is not yawing.
This may indicate

that the yaw sensor is not connected to the yaw rim or that the drive shaft of the sensor
1s broken or

that the cable to the sensor is defective. All of which may indicate that the
CableTwistProtectionStop

function in the safety system is impaired.

The alarm is triggered if ALL the following conditions are true for YawSpeedIntervalTime
time:

x **YawMotorsStarted** is true

«x **YawDemand** is "YawCW" or "YawCCw"

* YawDistance is smaller than
**YawMoveEvalThresholdGain*****YawSpeedNominal*****YawMoveEvalDelayTime**

The supervision collects data for a period of **YawMoveEvalResetTime** seconds. Every
time the

turbine begins to yaw, the supervision will wait for **YawMoveDelayTime** seconds before
data is collected

for evaluation.

YawDistance is found by integrating **YawSpeed**. YawDistance is then compared to a
percentage of the

of the nominal yaw distance, defined by **YawMoveEvalThresholdGain**. The expected
nominal yaw

distance is found by multiplying **YawSpeedNominal** with **YawMoveEvalDelayTime**, which
is the collected

active Yaw time required for the evaluation to begin.

The timeout period **YawMoveFvalResetTime** defines the time before the supervision
resets and start
over the evaluation process.

Criteria:

Alarm due to High Sum Current IMSC inside power module.

RMS of the sum of the instantaneous currents are calculated for each MSC active power

module (1,2,3,4). If the summation current is above Typical = 0.01 (SumCurrent LimPx) of
nominal module current (IG NOM ModulePx = 1247A), the protection 1s active.

If this condition goes on for typical = 3s (HighSumCurrentTimePx) the turbine will be
stopped.

The supervision can be disabled by (EnableMSCIntraStackHighSumCurrentPx=0).
Limits, rated values and duration can vary on different turbine types.

It is reported in parl which winding (some generator variants can have more than one) and
which PSC module is with the supervision active. In par2 the value of the summation
current that triggered the error is presented.

Criteria:

The Machine Side Converter (MSC) currents of an individual PSC module are unbalanced.

The mean value of three-phase currents RMS (e.g., (IConvlA RMS + IConv2A RMS +
IConv3A RMS)/3) are calculated for each active power module (ABCD).

The protection is evaluating that each phase current is not larger or smaller than the
mean current by typical = 12% (AsymMSCCurrent LimPx) of the rated module current of
typical = 1135A (IG NOM ModulePx).

If this condition goes on for typical = 3s (AsymMSCCurrentTimePx) the turbine will be
stopped.

The supervision can be disabled by (EnableMSCIntraStackAsymCurrentPx=0).

Criteria:

The stator(generator) voltages, which are measured in each winding-set, are out of the
expected values according to the generator speed.

The check is performed when the stator sensor is closed and the generator speed is above

(EnableStatBEMFVoltSupervisionPx=0).

For each phase of each winding, the voltage is compared with a curve of expected voltage
according to the generator speed.

The expected voltage curve is taken from a look-up-table defined by the parameters
(VoltageVsSpeed Speedx, VoltageVsSpeed Voltagex, in which x=1..5). A linear interpolation
is made between the points defined.

The tolerance in pu of nominal speed (Gen Nom Speed) is also defined by a curve
(VoltageVsSpeedTol Speedx, VoltageVsSpeedTol VoltagePUx, in which x=1..5).

If the measured voltage is out of the tolerance for a defined time

(StatBEMFVoltLimTimePx) the alarm will be raised.
