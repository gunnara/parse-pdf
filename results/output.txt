General

This list contains supervision descriptions for all Mk3A/B/E turbine(s) with VMP GlobalTM software. Not all supervisions,

however, is applicable for all variants within this range of turbines. This means you can find supervision descriptions for

supervisions which cannot be reported by given turbine variants.

- Time window 1 hour - Max time eliminate 9 second

- Stabilize period 60 second Category Manufacturer
Criteria:

This supervision monitors whether pitch position follows the pitch reference during
normal operation of the turbine.

This alarm is activated if the following conditions are met for more than **Dev\ Time**
seconds,

1. **Dev\ ActivityLevel** is True
2. **xSafetyPitchActive** is False
3. **PitchBladeBAngle** is less than **Dev\ MaxPitchRef**
4. The absolute value of the pitch deviation is above the threshold **Dev\ MaxError** +
**Dev\ MaxPitchDevAddDWG**
This pitch deviation is calculated as the difference between of two signals
**PiRM\ PitchPosRefB** and **PitchBladeBAngle**,
where the signal **PiRM\ PitchPosRefB** is low pass filtered with a time constant of
**Dev\ PitchTimeConst**.

The parameter **Dev\ MaxPitchDevAddDWG** is added as a part of the threshold if
**Dev\ DWGAddPitchEnable** is true & DWG StateB > 1.

Otherwise it takes zero value. The DWG activity computation also includes a hysterisis
time of **Dev\ DWGTimeHyst**.

- Stabilize period <n/a> Category Manufacturer
Criteria:

This supervision monitors the deviation between pitch positions A, B and C. An alarm is
raised if the maximum deviation between the blades exceeds a predefined threshold.

The supervision is enabled if the following conditions are met:

1. **DevABC\ ActivityLevel** = 2
2. **SafetyPitchActive** is False
3. Absolute value of **ProdCtrl.SP\ RotorSpdEst** > **DevABC\ MinRotSpd**

The alarm is activated if the following additional conditions are met:

1. The maximum pitch deviation is greater than **DevABC\ MaxPitchDev**, if

**DevABC\ DWGAddPitchEnable** = 0

2. The maximum pitch deviation is greater than the sum of **DevABC\ MaxPitchDev** and
**DevABC\ MaxPitchDevAddDWG**, if **DevABC\ DWGAddPitchEnable** = 1 and Dynamic Wind
Guard (DWG) is active

3. Either condition 1 or 2 is active for at least **DevABC\ MaxTime** sec

The maximum pitch deviation is calculated as:

1. The three individual pitch references, **PiRM\ PitchPosRefA**, **PiRM\ PitchPosRefB**
and **PiRM\ PitchPosRefC** are low pass filtred with a time constant

**DevABC\ PitchTimeConst**.

2. The pitch error between these filtered references and the corresponding measured pitch
positions, **PitchBladeAAngle**, **PitchBladeBAngle** and **PitchBladeCAngle**, are found
for each blade.

3. The maximum pitch deviation is then calculated as the difference between max pitch
error, **PiSV\_ PitchPosMaxError**, and min pitch error, **PiSV\ PitchPosMinError**, among
the three blades.

Dynamic Wind Guard (DWG) is considered active if either DWG StateA, DWG StateB or
DWG StateC is True. Subject to a hysterisis time of **DevABC\ DWGTimeHyst** sec.
