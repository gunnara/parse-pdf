Criteria:

This supervision monitors the deviation between pitch positions A, B and C. An alarm is
raised if the maximum deviation between the blades exceeds a predefined threshold.

The supervision is enabled if the following conditions are met:

1. **DevABC\ ActivityLevel** = 2
2. **SafetyPitchActive** is False
3. Absolute value of **ProdCtrl1.SP\ RotorSpdEst** > **DevABC\ MinRotSpd**

**DevABC\ DWGAddPitchEnable** = 0

2. The maximum pitch deviation is greater than the sum of **DevABC\ MaxPitchDev** and
**DevABC\ MaxPitchDevAddDWG**, if **DevABC\ DWGAddPitchEnable** = 1 and Dynamic Wind
Guard (DWG) 1S active

3. Either condition 1 or 2 is active for at least **DevABC\ MaxTime** sec

The maximum pitch deviation is calculated as:

1. The three individual pitch references, **PiRM\ PitchPosRefA**, **PiRM\ PitchPosRefB**
and **PiRM\ PitchPosRefC** are low pass filtred with a time constant

**DevABC\ PitchTimeConst**.

2. The pitch error between these filtered references and the corresponding measured pitch
positions, **PitchBladeAAngle**, **PitchBladeBAngle** and **PitchBladeCAngle**, are found
For each blade.

3. The maximum pitch deviation is then calculated as the difference between max pitch
error, **PiSV\ PitchPosMaxError**, and min pitch error, **PiSV\ PitchPosMinError**, among
the three blades.

Dynamic Wind Guard (DWG) 1s considered active if either DWG StateA, DWG StateB or
DWG StateC is True. Subject to a hysterisis time of **DevABC\ DWGTimeHyst** sec.

An alarm is raised if the following conditions are met:

1. **WindSpdHighSlow\ ActivityLevel** = 2
2. A filtered wind speed signal 1s above a certain wind speed limit for a certain time as
defined below.

The wind speed limit and time are specified as follows:

a. The wind speed signal **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** is filtered through a lowpass
filter with time constant **WindSpdHigh\ WindSpdFiltTauSlow**.

b. The filtered wind speed signal 1S input to a square filter whose output defines the
State of the supervision. The square filter has the following parameters:

* HighHyst = **WindSpdHigh\ CutoutWindsSpd** +
**WindSpdHighSlow\ CutoutWindSpdoffset** if
**WindSpdHigh\ ClimateDependentCutoutEnable** = 0

HighHyst = **WindSpdHigh\ ClimateDependentCutoutWindSpd** +
**WindSpdHighSlow\ CutoutWindSpdoffset** if
**WindSpdHigh\ ClimateDependentCutoutEnable** = 1

* LowHyst = HighHyst - **WindSpdHighSlow\ Hyst**

* HighHystTime = **WindSpdHighSlow\ HighHystTime**

* LowHystTime = **WindSpdHighSlow\ LowHystTime**

Category Manufacturer

The signal **IO.HydrOilLeakageHubSensorok** is only monitored if the parameter
*xHydrsuperviseOilleakagelInHub** is true.

The alarm 1s raised if one of the following conditions are met:

1. The signal **1IO.HydrOilLeakageHubSensoroOk** is FALSE for
*xHydrOilleakageDetectedTime**
2. There has been too many leakage counts (**HydrPressControlMaxCount**) within a certain
time (**HydrOilbLeakageInHubMaxWindowTime**). To avoid false leakage counts, leakage can
only be detected once within a certain timeframe
(**HydrOillLeakageInHubStabilizePeriod**).

This means, even though In HydrOilLeakageHubSensorOk goes FALSE a number of times
within the same timeframe, the leakage count will only be increased by 1.

The alarm ensure that the turbine 1s stopped if the grid voltage is too low for too long

turbine, but also to protect the grid and disconnect if the grid conditions are abnormal.

4 parameters (RTt1lPx[s], RTUgridlPx[pu] and RTt2Px[s], RTUgrid2Px[pu]) describes a
voltage versus time curve

These specifies the minimum allowed grid voltage to a given time after the grid dip has
Started.

If the voltage drop is below this curve, either because the voltage becomes too low or
the

duration is too long, this supervision 1s reported and the turbine is stopped.

The protection function is using the lowest voltage from 4 inputs (3 phase voltages and
the positive sequence voltage)

which it compares with a preset curve from (RTt1lPx[s], RTUgridlPx[pu]) and (RTt2Px([sl,

Criteria:

This supervision monitors the guality of blade load signals by detecting if the blade
load signals has very different standard deviations
A warning 1s triggered if the following conditions are met:

1. **TYC\ GainHyst\ Enablesv** = 1

2. **Turbine.ProdCtrl.SP\ RotorSpdEst** is greater than

**TYC\ GainHyst\ MinRotSpdForLog**

3. StdMinMaxRatio 1s continuously less than a wind speed dependent limit for
**TYC\ GainHyst\ PotentialFaultTimeout** seconds

StdMinMaxRatio is calculated as the ratio of the minimum and maximum standard
deviation of the three flapwise root moment signals (**BladeLoadA**, **BladeLoadB**,
**BladeLoadC**% )

highpass filtered with cutoff frequency **TYC\ GainHyst\ LoadSignalHpFiltFreq**. The
Standard deviation estimates are saturated to a minimum value of
**TYC\ GainHyst\ MinBladeLoadStd**.

The standard deviation is calculated for each flapwise root moment with a window
length of **TYC\ GainHyst\ LoadWindowTime**.

The limit for StdMinMaxRatio is calculated based on the average wind speed and
interpolated using a curve having x-axis defined by points
[**TYC\ GainHyst\ WindPointl**, **TYC\ GainHyst\ WindPoint2**,
**TYC\ GainHyst\ WindPoint3** |
and y-axis defined by [**TYC\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit1**,
**TYC\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit2**, **TYC\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit3**].

The wind speed **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** is averaged with a window length of
**TYC\ GainHyst\ WindWindowTime**.

The warning is cleared if:

- **Turbine.ProdCtr1l.SP\ RotorSpdEst** drops below **TYC\ GainHyst\ MinRotSpdForLog**
or

- StdMinMaxRatio becomes greater than the current limit plus a hystersis parameter

Criteria:

This supervision monitors the number of blade unlocking attempts and reacts when it
exceeds the maximum attempt.

This alarm 1s activated if the the following conditions are met:

1. **ProdCtr1l.PSC\ UnlockBlades** = 1

2. **BL\ UBA\ ActivityLevel** = 2

3. Number of blade unlock attempts for blade A exceeds the upper threshold,
**BL\ UBA\ MaxAttempts**

Blade unlock functionality should be able to unlock the blade from 90 degrees and place
the blade in the idle position (**BL\ IdlePitchPos**), ready for operation.

The pitch control signal is saturated by **BL\ PropValveLimit** to avoid damaging the
pawl and the wedge during the unlock sequence.

Unlocking of blades is performed by the following steps:

1. Reset the counter for unlock attempts for blade A to zero.

2. If needed, the precise end stop position is established by increasing the pitch
reference and detect when the blade stops.

3 The detected end stop position is validated and if found outside limits, the procedure
1S re-initiated and the unlock attempts counter 1s incremented

4. Pitching the blade A towards **BL\ IdlePitchPos**.

5. Check if the pitch movement is limited by width of the pawl hole of the wedge for
**BL\ StoppedTime** seconds.

6. If the pitch movement indicates that the pitch is still locked, the blade A will move
back and forth and thereby try to open the lock. **BL\ IdlePitchPos** and

**BL\ HigherLimit** are used as pitch references.

7. Increase the number of blade unlock attempts for blade A by l.

8. When PitchBladeBAngle <= **BL\ PositiveEndStop** - **BL\ BladeLockWidth**, the pitch
rate is increased to **BL\ PitchRateFast** from **BL\ PitchRate**..

9. Check the blade A is in **BL\ IdlePitchPos** position, indicates that blade A lock is
ready for unlocking.

10. If the blade A has not unlocked, then repeat from step 5 until the blade A is
unlocked.

Unlock the blades by actuating the hydraulic pawl, BladeLockValveOpen, when all three
Blade Locks are ready.

- 1) If Load & PowerModes is enabled and no wind sectors and default configurations are
used:

T.e **LaPMMEnabled** is true, **WindSectorsUsed** is 0Q,**PartialLoadDefaultMode** is
O and **FullLoadDefaultMode** is QO.
- 2) If there is an overlap between 2 Load & Power Modes sectors. I.e. the direction
range from **WindSectorl.SectorAngleBegin** to **WindSectorl.SectorAngleEnd** must only
be covered by one sector.
- 3) If **WaindSectorl.SectorAngleBegin** is different from **WindSectorl.SectorAngleEnd**
for e.g. sector 1 and all the following 3 modes are set to O for the same sector:

1. *xWindSectorl.PartialLoadMode** = Q
2D. *xWindSectorl.FullLoadLowwWindMode** = Q
3. **WaindSectorl.FullLoadHighWindMode** = 0

- The warnings arguments are invalid sector number and related sector configuration.
- The warning can be acknowledged when the parameters are reconfigured to remove the
issues above.

- WindSectorl 1s used as an example for above parameters.

Criteria:

This supervision is raised if the reactive power absorbed by the grid filter is lower
than expected.

Prior to charging the converter the grid filter is activated and only if the reactive

This supervision is raised if the reactive power absorbed by the grid filter is lower

Prior to charging the converter the grid filter is activated and only if the reactive
power absorbed by

the grid filter is sufficiently high the turbine is allowed to run. Auxiliary equipment
being connected or

disconnected during the measurement process can interfere with the measurement and give
rare false alarms.

Parl: Difference in reactive power (QL) absorbed by the Gridfilter and expected
absorbtion [kVAr]
Par2: Minimum limit of reactive power for the check to pass [kKVAr]

Alarm condition:

The Alarm occurs when the calculated reactive power consumption from the gridfilter
Capacitors are less than the expected

minimum reactive power consumption. The reactive power is calculated based on capacitance
of gridfilter (C GridFilter Module), if the measured reactive power (QL) <

(Q Gridfilter LowFactor) *nominal QOL, then the error wil occur. it will do the measurement
in GridFilterFuseCheckTime amount of time.

Possible causes:

* One or more grid filter fuses are blown.
* Contactors to the filters are not working or not wired correct.
* Defect capacitors (each capacitor should absorb approximate 30kVA(50Hz) and 35kVAr
(©60HzZ)) at rated voltage and the turbine has 6 caps leading to a total QO of 180KkVAr
(50HzZ) and 210 kVAr (60Hz).
* If the phase sequence on the voltages (UL1,UL2,UL3) and currents (IL1,IL2,1IL3) are not
correct the measured reactive power

will not be correct and the error can be reported. Only relevant during first run-up of
the turbine.

Check connection from the current transducers to the tru-board and from the tru-board
to the VPC (CT-460).
* The value of reactive power must be positive, if it 1S negative, then either phase
sequence iS wrong or wiring on the current transducer / TRU board is switched.

Criteria:

This alarm 1s raised if the Machine Side Converter (MSC) currents are not balanced
between the converter modules inside each winding-set.

A mean module current 1s calculated for all active modules (f.x. 1,2,3,4) and phases
(1,2,3) inside each winding-set, and first when the mean current is above Typical = 400A
(RmsIMSCLoadshareActiveLlevel ModulePx) the load share protection 1s active.

The protection 1s evaluating that all module RMS currents are not larger or smaller than
typical = 12% (RmsIMSCMarginLoadshare ModulePx) of the rated module current of typical =
LI3SA (IG NOM ModulePx).

If this condition goes on for typical = 3s (MSCLoadShareMaxTimePx) the turbine will be
stopped.

Limits, rated values and duration can vary on different turbine types.

In case a PSC module is taken a higher/lower current share it is reported which module is
taken less/more of its share and which phase the current has been measured too high/low.

3=ModuleC, 4=ModuleD)
Par2 : Phase (1=L1,2=L2, 3=L3)

Possible fault reasons:

The error 1S expected to be generated if a sensor error 1S present or a PSC module is not
working correct.

Poor cabling between generator and converter modules

Hardware parts not inside specifications (PSC, chokes, Gate drivers etc. )

comments

It is possible to see in toolkit converter monitoring, which module is low/high in
converter current. Alternatively the stream from the converter can be collected for
debugging

To deactivate the alarm the "EnableMSCCurrentLoadSharePx" can be set to Q. (only allowed
for verry controlled troubleshooting, as modules can be overloaded if the current share
1s not correct).

Criteria:

This alarm 1S raised when the yaw system starts untwisting.
The cable is being untwisted in clockwise (CW) direction.
The untwisting can be initiated by any of the the following events:

1. The cables has been twisted so much that an untwist is required. The amount of twist
1s stored in the software signal **CableTwist**. The criterias

for starting the untwisting 1s dependant on the number of degrees the cable has been
twisted and the current windspeed.
2. The yaw lubrication system has requested the yaw system to turn the nacelle as a part
of a greasing cycle. That is handled by untwisting one

revolution.

Before the untwist is started the generator speed is derated to O RPM and the alarm
UntwistCW is raised.

The untwist starts when the generator speed is low enough for starting the search, 1.e.
*x*GeneratorTachoSpeed** < **YawingOutWindMaxGeneratorRPM**.

Criteria:

This warning 1s raised if the yaw sensor is shifting in
the opposite yaw direction as the yaw motors currently are
turning the nacelle.

The warning may be caused by the CableTwist sensors or the
Wiring to the yaw motors or the nacelle position encoder has been fitted incorrectly.

The warning 1s triggered 1f all the following conditions are true:

* **YawMotorssStarted** and **YawDemand** = YawCW or CCW has been true for the last
**YawMoveDelayTime** time

x **YawDemand** has value "YawCW" and CableTwist decreases OR **YawDemand** has value
"YawCCw" and CableTwist increases

The supervision will collect data for a period of **YawMoveEvalResetTime** seconds.
Everytime the

turbine begins to yaw, the supervision will wait for **YawMoveDelayTime** seconds before
data 1s collected

for evaluation.

YawDistance is found by integrating **YawSpeed**. After a total collected data of
**YawMoveEvalDelayTime** seconds

the sign of the YawDistance 1S compared to the expected yaw direction and the warning
activated if YawDistance

has the wrong sign.

The timeout period **YawMoveEvalResetTime** defines the time before the supervision
resets and start

over the evaluation process.

The warning can be acknowledged at any time.

Criteria:

This alarm 1S raised when the yaw system starts to search for the reset position of
the nacelle position sensor.

The search for the reset position 1s needed because the software signal
**XNacellePosition**
has become unavailable.

some examples of reasons for the **NacellePosition** becoming unavailable:

The nacelle position encoder is out of order

The nacelle has been yawing faster than it can be detected

There has been problems with the reset position of the nacelle position. Il.e.
**FilteredNacellePositionReset** has either been missing at the expected reset
position or has been indicating reset at an unexpected position.

Before the search for the reset position is started the generator speed is de-rated
to Q RPM and the alarm is raised.

The search for the reset position starts when the wind speed and generator speed is
low enough for starting the search,

1.e. **WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanlOOs** < (**MediumWindStartProduction** -
**AutomaticYawControlwindHyst**)

and the **GeneratorTachoSpeed** < **YawingOutWindMaxGeneratorRPM**.

The nacelle position is being reset once for each revolution of the nacelle.
The reset happens when one of the following situations happens:

* The signal **FilteredNacellePositionReset** switches from true to false if passed
while yawing counterclockwise

* The signal **FilteredNacellePositionReset** switches from false to true if passed
while yawing clockwise

During the search for the reset position this alarm combined with the de-rate of
generator speed keeps the turbine from producing power.

When the search for the reset position has ended (1.e. reset position 1s passed) the
alarm 1S automatically acknowledged.
During the search for the reset position the alarm cannot be acknowledged.

The search for the reset position 1s needed because the signal **CableTwist** has become

Before the search 1s started the generator speed is derated to Q RPM and
YawToCableTwistReset is raised.

The search for the reset position starts when the wind speed and generator speed is low
enough for starting the search, i.e. **WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanl0OOQs** <
(**MediumWindStartProduction** - **AutomaticYawControlWindHyst**) and the
**GeneratorTachoSpeed** < **YawingOutWindMaxGeneratorRPM**.

The cable twist reset position is at the position where CableTwistCode shifts from 3 to
4.

During the search for the reset position this alarm combined with the derate of generator
speed keeps the turbine from producing power.

When the search for the reset position has ended the alarm is automatically acknowledged.
During the search for the reset position the alarm cannot be acknowledged.

The alarm 1s caused by either:

* The filtered wind speed exceeds a parameterized limit.
* SCADA/Operator Panel has commanded the turbine into Extended Yaw mode.

The alarm 1s triggered if **ExtendedYawEnabled** is true and ANY the following conditions

* Status signal for **WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanl0OQs** is Valid AND
*x*WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanlOUsS** exceeds **ExtendedYawWindStart**
x x*x*ExtendedYawMode** has value "ForcedOn"

The alarm can be acknowledged if **ExtendedYawEnabled** is false OR ALL of the following
two conditions are true:

* Status signal for **WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanl0OQs** 1s not Valid OR

* Status signal for **WindMeasurement.WindSpeedExpMeanl0OQs** is Valid AND

* ValidWindSpeedExpMeanlO0OsS is smaller than the difference: **ExtendedYawWindStart** -

The alarm is disabled if **ExtendedYawEnabled** is false.

Yawing upwind is highest priority when Extended Yaw is active. Untwist and other
operations keeping the nacelle out of the wind are aborted when Extended Yaw 1s active.

In auto mode extended yaw 1s activated by high wind speed. In forced mode extended yaw 1s
always activated independent of the wind speed.

Criteria:

This supervision monitors the status of the sensor used for Pitch Force Boost and Pitch
Blocking.

The sensor is the pressure sensor on the pitch block PitchBlockCCylinderPress.

If this supervision is active Pitch Force Boost and Pitch Blocking will not be active
leading

to potential high loads on the turbine.

The loss of these features may lead to shutdowns during operation at high winds.
Possible Causes:

- Failure of the pressure sensor
- Loss of connection with the pressure sensor

Criteria:

This supervision monitors the guality of blade load signals by detecting if the blade
load signals has very different standard deviations
A warning 1s triggered if the following conditions are met:

1. **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ Enable** = 1

2. **SP\ RotorSpdEst** is greater than **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ MinRotSpd**

3. StdMinMaxRatio 1s continuously less than a wind speed dependent limit for
**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ PotentialFaultTimeout** seconds

StdMinMaxRatio is calculated as the ratio of the minimum and maximum standard
deviation of the three flapwise root moment signals (**BladeLoadA**, **BladeLoadB**,
**BladeLoadC**% )

highpass filtered with cutoff frequency **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ LoadSignalHpFiltFreq**.
The standard deviation estimates are saturated to a minimum value of
**TL\ VIL\ GainHyst\ MinBladeLoadStd**.

The standard deviation is calculated for each flapwise root moment with a window
length of **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ LoadWindowTime**.

The limit for StdMinMaxRatio is calculated based on the average wind speed and
interpolated using a curve having x-axis defined by points
[**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ WindPointl**, **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ WindPoint2**,
**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ WindPoint3** |
and y-axis defined by [**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit1**,
**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit2**, **TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ StdRatioLimit3**].

The wind speed **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** is averaged with a window length of
**TL\ VTL\ GainHyst\ WindWindowTime**.

The warning is cleared if:

- **SP\ RotorSpdEst** drops below TL VTL GainHyst MinRotSpdForLog or

- StdMinMaxRatio becomes greater than the current limit plus a hystersis parameter

could potentially endanger the structural integrity of the turbine. It 1s not permitted
to start up the turbine before an inspection of the gearbox and generator has been
performed. Please look into triggered time-traces to validate how high the rotor speed
has in fact been during the event. In rare cases, a false alarm could be caused by a
malfunction in the speed sensor or the control system, i.e. the actual speed have not
reached the trigger limit. In this case, the root cause must be identified but an
inspection of gearbox and generator might not be necessary.

The alarm 1s reported if the virtual signal **IO.OverspeedGuardMaxShutdownRotorsSpeed**
crossed the value of **RotorSpeedExtremeHigh**.

1. A large deviation between a measured blade load (flap, edge, axial) and the estimated
value has been detected.

- Log "5025 BladeLoadEstimatorDeviationDetected" will provide more information on which
blade and position is triggering.

2. A large deviation between the measured blade loads (flap, edge, axial) of two blades
has been detected.

- Log "5094 BladeToBladeLoadDeviationDetected" will provide more information on which
blade and position is triggering.

This warning will be acknowledged when all loads are within the specified limits.
When a warning is reported:

1. A sudden change in the loading (1.€. wind gust, wind shear) may cause the measured
loads to deviate from the estimator. No action reguired if only for a short time.

2. Certain operations may cause the blades to have different pitch which will cause the
loads to differ between blades.

3. Re-calibrate if this warning 1S repeating for unexplained reasons.

4. If the deviations continue, check for azimuth or pitch offsets.

Criteria:

The purpose of this supervision 1s to monitor tower second mode resultant RMS using tower
top accelerometer signals. Tower second

mode resultant value 1s captured by filtering the tower top accelerometer signals of X
and Y direction around tower second mode frequency.

The alarm 1s activated when the resultant second mode RMS content 1s above the threshold
limit defined by the wind speeds. The alarm can

be activated during all operating conditions including stand-still and normal operations.

This alarm is activated if the following conditions are met:

1. Px TowSecMode Activitylevel = 2
2. When the Tower Acceleration resultant RMS is greater than the threshold. The threshold
value is calculated as follows:

a. by interpolation between TowSecMode TowAccResl and TowSecMode TowAccRes2 , if 15
m/s < **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** <= 20 m/s

b. by interpolation between TowSecMode TowAccRes2z and TowSecMode TowAccRes3 , if 20
m/s < **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** <= 25 m/s

c. by interpolation between TowSecMode TowAccRes3 and TowSecMode TowAccRes4 , if 25
m/s < **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** <= 30 m/s

d. by interpolation between TowSecMode TowAccRes4 and TowSecMode TowAccRes5S , if 30
m/s < **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** <= 35 m/s

e. by interpolation between TowSecMode TowAccResS and TowSecMode TowAccReso , if 39
m/s < **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** <= 45 m/s

The **WindMeasurement.WindSpeed** is filtered by a low pass filter with time constant

Criteria:

This alarm 1S raised if the yaw speed of the nacelle is slower than a given limit.

The alarm may be caused if **YawMotorsStarted** is true, but the nacelle 1S not yawing.
This may indicate

that the yaw sensor is not connected to the yaw rim or that the drive shaft of the sensor
1s broken or

that the cable to the sensor is defective. All of which may indicate that the
CableTwistProtectionStop

Function in the safety system is impaired.

The alarm 1s triggered if ALL the following conditions are true for YawSpeediIntervalTime
time:

* **YawMotorsstarted** is true

* **YawDemand** is "YawCW" or "YawCCw"

* YawDistance is smaller than
**YawMoveEvalThresholdGain*****YawSpeedNominal*****YawMovekEvalDelayTime**

The supervision collects data for a period of **YawMoveEvalResetTime** seconds. Every
time the

turbine begins to yaw, the supervision will wait for **YawMoveDelayTime** seconds before
data 1s collected

for evaluation.

YawDistance is found by integrating **YawSpeed**. YawDistance is then compared to a
percentage of the

of the nominal yaw distance, defined by **YawMovekEvalThresholdGain**. The expected
nominal yaw

distance is found by multiplying **YawSpeedNominal** with **YawMoveEvalDelayTime**, which
is the collected

active Yaw time required for the evaluation to begin.

The timeout period **YawMoveEvalResetTime** defines the time before the supervision
resets and start
over the evaluation process.

This warning 1s raised if power management 1S activated on the turbine.

The power management 1S active if either the **PowerSaveActive** or the
**PowerRestrictionActive** signals are activated.

If power save mode is activated the turbine will reduce power consumption as much as
possible and

therefore motors, heaters and other power consuming actuators which are not critical for
the turbine are stopped.

Power save is not allowed if the turbine 1S in production.

In restricted power mode the turbine must be connected to SCADA in order to request power
when needed.
Power save 1S activated in restricted power mode.

Restricted power mode is allowed if all the following conditions are met:

* **xPowerSupplyRestrictedExternalPowerEnabled** is true
* Turbine 1s supplied from external generator, 1.e. **PowerBackupSource** is external
* Service mode is none

If service mode 1s entered during restricted power mode, restricted power is deactivated
but the turbine remains

Criteria:

Alarm due to High Sum Current IMSC inside power module.

RMS of the sum of the instantaneous currents are calculated for each MSC active power

module (1,2,3,4). If the summation current 1s above Typical = 0.01 (SumCurrent LimPx) of
nominal module current (IG NOM ModulePx = 1247A), the protection 1s active.

If this condition goes on for typical = 3s (HighSumCurrentTimePx) the turbine will be
stopped.

The supervision can be disabled by (EnableMSCIntraStackHighSumCurrentPx=0).
Limits, rated values and duration can vary on different turbine types.
